        <p><strong>Background: </strong>Ollie is the owner of a luxury penthouse in Manchester UK, offering stunning views of the city skyline. Despite its prime location and top-notch amenities, Ollie struggled to attract high-end guests willing to pay a premium price. He found herself frequently reducing rates just to fill the calendar, which ultimately impacted her bottom line and devalued his property’s exclusivity.</p>

        <p><strong>Challenge: </strong>Ollie wanted to maintain his penthouse’s high-end reputation without resorting to price cuts. He aimed to attract affluent guests who would appreciate the luxury experience his property offered. However, without the right strategies in place, his penthouse wasn’t reaching its full potential in terms of revenue or guest satisfaction.</p>

        <p><Strong>Ollie's Perspective: </Strong>"I knew my penthouse was special, but I was having trouble finding guests who valued it as much as I did. Lowering the price felt like selling myself short. I wanted to attract the right kind of guests who would appreciate the luxury I offered, but I didn’t know how to reach them."</p>
